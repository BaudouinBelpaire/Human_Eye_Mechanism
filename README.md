# Human Eye Mechanism:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The development of humanoid robots that mimic human behaviour holds a great promise 
across diverse applications. By reproducing natural gaze behaviours, such as maintaining eye 
contact, following objects of interest, and expressing emotions through eye movements, these 
robots can enhance human-robot interactions in various fields. In social robotics, humanoid 
robots with a realistic gaze behaviour can foster deeper connections with users. As research
progresses in this area, the integration of sophisticated gaze behaviour into humanoid robots 
has the potential to revolutionise the human interaction with robots and benefit from robotic 
technology in our daily lives. <br>

  
This project consists of a human eye robot capable of tracking moving objects and follow them like a natural human gaze by implementing computer vision techniques, robotics system design methods, and real-time processing. </p>
